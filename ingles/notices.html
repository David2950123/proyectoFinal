                    A study carried out by the Laboratory of Economics of the
                    Education of the Javeriana University calculated the percentage of
                    educational centers that are located in blocks where the largest
                    number of homes around does not have the service of
                    aqueduct. According to this report, at least 11% of schools
                    of the official sector in the country are located in neighborhoods where
                    more than half of the houses do not have an aqueduct. I know
                    also found a large gap because the same occurs only
                    in 1% of private schools, which would become a
                    serious problem of inequality for the return to alternation and
                    access to water in order to carry out the correct protocol
                    washing hands in schools amid the pandemic. The
                    study, also found that there are only differences between the
                    public and private sector, but also between rural areas and
                    urban.

                    such as Quindío and Bogotá, the percentage of official headquarters located
                    in blocks where more than half of the homes do not have
                    aqueduct is null; while, on the other, in Magdalena,

                    This research suggests that for these venues that do not have the
